Tom and his friends, Mark, Lisa, and Anna, are at his house playing a board game. During the game, Tom rolls the dice and lands on a space that requires him to draw a card that changes the game rules.

Tom reads the card aloud, "All players must swap their game pieces with the person to their right."

Mark laughs and says, "That's going to mix things up!"

Lisa smiles, nodding, and they all swap pieces. Anna, noticing Tom’s hesitation, asks, "Is everything okay with the new rule, Tom?"

Tom nods. "It's unexpected, but I think it can be fun. Thanks for checking, Anna."

They continue playing, adjusting to the new rule. After a couple of turns, Tom looks more relaxed and participates actively, making jokes about the swapped pieces. 

Please describe what [Tom] felt and what was difficult for them.

<< User >>: Tom was confused about the change, but I don't understand what does it have to do with me and the trip to the amusement park

Tom sits on a bench in the park reading a book. Nearby, Julie and Max are tossing a frisbee. The frisbee accidentally lands near Tom.

Julie walks up to Tom, smiles, and says, "Hi! Sorry, our frisbee sort of escaped. Could you throw it back, please?"

Tom looks up, nods, and picks up the frisbee. He stands and throws it back to Julie.

"Thanks!" Julie says, watching as Max catches the frisbee. She turns back to Tom. "Do you come here often? It's a great spot for reading."

Tom responds, "Yes, it's quiet and nice. I like reading here."

Julie nods. "What book are you reading?"

Tom shows her the cover. "It's a mystery novel."

"Cool, I love mysteries!" Julie comments. Max runs over, and Julie says, "Hey, Tom, would you like to join us for a bit? We could use a break."

Tom smiles and closes his book. "Sure, why not?"

Please describe what Tom felt and what was difficult for them.

Let’s talk about what you find challenging in real-life social interactions, especially about going to the amusement park. What parts of going to the amusement park worry you or are difficult to manage? We can discuss those directly.
<< User >>: My mum will not let me go and I really want to!

Lukas and Emma are walking down the street when they notice a new ice cream shop that wasn't there last week. Lukas looks surprised and points at the shop.

Lukas says, "Hey Emma, look! There’s a new ice cream place. It wasn't here last time."

Emma nods, smiling, "Yes, it’s new. I read online it opened yesterday. Want to try it out?"

Lukas checks his pockets then looks a bit unsure. "I didn’t bring enough money for ice cream today."

Emma quickly responds, "No problem! It’s on me today. Let’s see if they have your favorite flavor."

Lukas smiles gratefully, "Thanks, Emma! I hope they have mint chocolate chip."

They walk into the shop, and Lukas thanks Emma again as they approach the counter. Emma laughs and says, "Next time, it’s your treat, deal?" 

Lukas laughs and nods, "Deal!"

Please describe what Lukas felt and what was difficult for them.
