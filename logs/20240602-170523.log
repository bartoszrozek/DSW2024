Hi, I'm your conselor. Please specify which training you want to use:
- conversation with large group of people
- being witness of two people conversation
- work organization/multitasking
- dynamic change of plans
- reading irony
- negotiations
- stress management
Optionally, you can describe problematic situation that happened to you and I will try to help you with it.
<< User >>: I'd like to practice reading irony
------Conversationalist------
<< Assistant >>: That's a great choice, Martyna! Reading irony can be tricky, but practicing will definitely help. Let's start with an example. Imagine someone says, "Oh great, it started raining right when I forgot my umbrella!" even though their tone sounds cheerful and not upset. This is ironic because their tone and words don't match the situation. They are actually expressing annoyance in a sarcastic way because it's not really great that it's raining when they don't have an umbrella.

How do you think you would respond in this situation, or what do you think they are really feeling?
<< User >>: They are probably a little annoyed at the situation, but not that mad about it?

<< User >>: What steps? I already told you that I would like to practice irony!
------Conversationalist------
<< Assistant >>: I apologize for the confusion earlier, Martyna. Let's continue practicing irony. You were right that the person in the example might be a little annoyed but not very mad about forgetting their umbrella. Now, can you think of a reply you might give if someone said that to you in an ironic way? Or do you have any other situations involving irony that you find confusing?
<< User >>: I could smile since they are joking
------Conversationalist------
<< Assistant >>: You've got a good idea, Martyna. Smiling can be a great response because it shows that you understand they're not being completely serious and are joking a bit with their irony. If you feel comfortable, you could even add a light-hearted comment like, "Guess it's time to practice your rain dance!" This can help keep the conversation friendly and show that you're engaged. How does that sound? Would you like to try another example or talk about a different situation?
