 << Assistant >>: OK, I understand that. Maybe we would try to work on this imaginary situation.

Alex is sitting on a bench in the park, reading a book. Leo approaches with a frisbee in hand and stops near Alex. 

Leo: "Hey, do you want to join us for a game of frisbee?"

Alex looks up, a bit unsure, then smiles slightly. 

Alex: "Sure, I've never played before. Could you show me how?"

Leo nods, his face lighting up with a smile. 

Leo: "Of course, it's easy! I'll show you."

They walk over to where Mia is standing. Mia waves at Alex. 

Mia: "Great to have you join us, Alex!"

Leo demonstrates how to throw the frisbee, and they start playing. Alex tries a few throws, each getting better. Mia laughs when Alex finally makes a successful catch.

Mia: "Nice catch, Alex!"

Alex grins, feeling more relaxed. 

Please describe what Alex felt and what was difficult for them.
