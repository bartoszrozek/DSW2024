Tom is sitting in the living room with his friends Anna, Jack, and Emma. They are all talking about their favorite movies. Jack mentions a new superhero movie, and everyone seems excited about it.

Tom listens for a while and sees that Emma nods enthusiastically when Jack talks about the action scenes. Tom wants to join in and share his thoughts. He waits for a moment when the conversation slows down, then says, "I also saw that movie last weekend. The action scenes were really cool, especially the car chase."

Anna smiles and responds, "Yes, the car chase was fantastic! What did you think about the ending, Tom?"

Tom takes a moment to collect his thoughts, then replies, "I thought the ending was surprising. It made me excited for the next movie."

They all nod, and Jack adds, "I can't wait to see what happens next!"

They continue discussing other movies they're interested in.

Please describe what Tom felt and what was difficult for them.

<< User >>: Tom wanted to join a conversation and could do that because he also saw the movie.

Tom is at the playground sitting on a bench. He notices Alex, a classmate, jogging towards him. Alex stops and smiles at Tom.

Alex says, "Hey Tom, how's it going?"

Tom nods and replies, "Good, thanks. What about you?"

Alex, catching his breath, responds, "Great! Just trying to stay active. Do you come here often?"

Tom shakes his head, "Not really, just sometimes when it's not too crowded."

Alex laughs lightly, "I get that. It’s nice to have some space, right?"

Tom smiles slightly, "Yeah, exactly."

Alex then says, "Well, gotta keep moving. See you around, Tom?"

Tom replies, "Sure, see you."

Alex waves as he starts jogging again, and Tom watches him for a moment before looking elsewhere.

Please describe what Tom felt and what was difficult for them.
